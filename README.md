# 🎍CLEANUp
This is a project I and my team worked on for the google solution challenge using Nuxt JS, It was my second time usig Nuxt JS

This project is aimed at reducing 🥤🥤plastic waste in the community there by acheiving SDG goal.

Working on this project open me to team work, exposed me to using library and my ablity to learn fast still amaze me
because I and my team were working against a deadline and they barely have a knowledge of the framework.

Although our solutions were not selected but I do like to futher on this project,
So I'm open to contributions and suggestion🤗.

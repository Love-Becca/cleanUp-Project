# 🎍CLEANUp
This is a project I and my team worked on for the google solution chanllenge using Nuxt JS, It was my second time usig Nuxt

The project is aimed to reducing 🥤🥤plastic waste in the community there by acheiving SDG goal
Working on this project open me to team work, exposed me to library and my ablity to learn fast still amaze me
because I and my team were working against a deadline and they barely have a knowledge of the framework.

Although our solutions were not selected but I do like to futher on this project,
So I'm open to contributions and suggestion🤗.
